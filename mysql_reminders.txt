Mysql is ridiculous and everything needs to be:
 Character Set utf8mb4
 Collation utf8mb4_unicode_ci (case insensitive)
 
utf8 in mysql is BMP, or 3 bytes / not emoji etc.


To test for character set, you can run:

SELECT table_name, column_name, character_set_name FROM information_schema.`COLUMNS`  WHERE table_schema = "contentapi";


To check tables for collation and field sizes (indexes are limited in size and you're going from 3 to 4 bytes):

SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM Entities;


To alter database to force utf8mb4:

alter database contentapi character set = utf8mb4 collate = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;


To alter an existing table:

alter table EntityValues convert to character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci;




NOTE: just run mysqlModify.sql to do what you need. Copy my.cnf to /etc/my.cnf, follow instructions in there.
